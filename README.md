1. Project Overview
The RFID-Based Door Access Control System is an embedded system that utilizes RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology to control access to a secured area or a door. The system consists of an ESP8266 microcontroller, an RFID module, a 16x2 LCD display, and a web server. Users are required to authenticate using a web-based interface before being granted access.

2. Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a secure and user-friendly access control system that provides controlled access to a specific area. The system should be able to:

Allow authorized users to unlock the door using their RFID cards.
Maintain a list of authorized users and their RFID card information.
Allow administrators to add or remove users through a web interface.
Provide a secure login mechanism for administrators to manage the system.
3. Hardware Components
The following hardware components are used in the project:

ESP8266 WiFi module
MFRC522 RFID module
16x2 I2C LCD display
Electronic lock mechanism
Buzzer
LEDs
Breadboard and connecting wires
4. Software Components
The software components used in the project include:

Arduino IDE for programming the ESP8266 microcontroller.
Libraries such as Wire, MFRC522, LiquidCrystal_I2C, ESP8266WiFi, and ESP8266WebServer.
Google Apps Script for cloud-based data storage.
HTML and CSS for creating web interfaces.
5. System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture:

The ESP8266 microcontroller serves as the client and controls the hardware components.
The Google Apps Script acts as a server to store and manage authorized user data.
The web server running on the ESP8266 microcontroller provides a user interface for administrators and communicates with the Google Apps Script server.
6. Functionalities
The RFID-Based Door Access Control System offers the following functionalities:

RFID card authentication for access control.
Web-based user interface for administrators to manage users.
Real-time feedback through the 16x2 LCD display.
Audible feedback using a buzzer.
LED indicators for system status.
Secure user authentication for administrators.
Ability to add, remove, and view authorized users.
7. User Guide
For Administrators:
Connect to the system's WiFi network.
Open a web browser and navigate to the system's IP address (default: http://<ESP8266_IP>/).
Log in with the provided username and password.
Add or remove users as needed.
For Users:
Present an authorized RFID card to the RFID module.
The system will either grant or deny access and provide visual and audible feedback.
8. Results
The RFID-Based Door Access Control System successfully provides access control based on RFID card authentication. Administrators can easily manage user access through a web interface, and the system provides real-time feedback to users.

9. Challenges and Limitations
Limited storage capacity: The EEPROM storage of the ESP8266 has a limited capacity for storing user data.
Security: While the system offers basic security for administrators, further security measures can be implemented.
Scalability: The system may require additional features for scalability in larger environments.
10. Future Improvements
Implement a database for more extensive storage of user data.
Enhance security features, such as multi-factor authentication.
Enable remote access and control via a mobile app.
Integrate with a cloud-based authentication service for user management.
11. Conclusion
The RFID-Based Door Access Control System provides a secure and user-friendly solution for access control. It can be used in various applications, including homes, offices, and industrial facilities, to ensure authorized access to secured areas.
